# Requirements for system

A casual tool for generating and decoding UUIDs with comprehensive format.

**Experience Qualities**:

1. **Efficient** - Quick generation and instant analysis without unnecessary complexity
2. **Reliable** - Accurate UUID handling with proper validation and error feedback
3. **Professional** - Clean, technical interface that inspires confidence in developers

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)

- Combines UUID generation, decoding, and format conversion in a single focused tool

## Essential Features

**UUID Generation**:

- Functionality: Generate random UUIDs in multiple versions (v1, v4, v7) with batch generation support
- Purpose: Provide developers with reliable UUID generation for various use cases
- Trigger: Click generate button or select specific UUID version
- Progression: Select version → Configure options → Generate → Copy to clipboard
- Success criteria: Valid UUIDs generated according to RFC 4122 specifications

**UUID Analysis & Decoding**:

- Functionality: Parse and extract metadata from existing UUIDs including version, timestamp, node info
- Purpose: Help developers understand and debug UUID structure and properties
- Trigger: Paste or type UUID into analysis field
- Progression: Input UUID → Validate format → Extract metadata → Display results
- Success criteria: Accurate parsing with comprehensive metadata display

**Batch Operations**:

- Functionality: Generate multiple UUIDs at once with configurable quantity
- Purpose: Efficiently create UUIDs for bulk operations or testing
- Trigger: Specify quantity and generate batch
- Progression: Set quantity → Generate batch → Display list → Copy all or individual
- Success criteria: Generate specified number of valid UUIDs efficiently

## Edge Case Handling

- **Invalid UUID Input**: Clear error messaging with format examples and correction suggestions
- **Large Batch Requests**: Reasonable limits (max 100) with performance considerations and progress indication
- **Clipboard Access**: Graceful fallback when clipboard API unavailable with manual selection options
- **Version Compatibility**: Handle deprecated UUID versions with appropriate warnings
- **Malformed Input**: Robust parsing that identifies partial or corrupted UUIDs

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Cards for section organization, Buttons for actions, Input fields for UUID entry, Tabs for different operations, Badge components for UUID versions, Copy buttons with toast feedback
- **Customizations**: Monospace text display component for UUIDs, custom number input for batch quantity, UUID validation styling
- **States**: Buttons show loading states during generation, inputs highlight validation errors, success states with green accents
- **Icon Selection**: Copy icon for clipboard actions, refresh for generation, info for analysis sections, warning for validation errors
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base spacing with 24px section gaps, 8px for related elements
- **Mobile**: Stack sections vertically, ensure touch-friendly 44px minimum targets, responsive text scaling for UUID display

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional UUID versions or formats.
- A feature to convert UUIDs between different formats (e.g., with/without hyphens).
- Saving and managing a history of generated UUIDs.
